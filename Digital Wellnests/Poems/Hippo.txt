9-Happy Hippo

Ron the Rhino has many friends in his class.
He plays with them at break time and they share lunch on the grass.
As they laughed and talked about websites that are cool,
Henry the Hippo walked down from the school.

Henry was crying while looking at his phone,
So Ron went to Henry so that he won't be alone.
Why are you crying? Ron asked his friend.
So Henry showed him a message that somebody sent.

"You are a fat Hippo and ugly too...
Go away from here. No one likes you!"
Who sent this to you? Ron asked. This is very cruel.
Is it from somebody here at the school?

I don't know, said Henry. I get one every day.
I was not mean to anybody. Why am I his prey?
But it's just text messages - maybe it's not a big deal.
I don't want to tell people how this makes me feel.
I have not told anybody that this makes me feel hurt.
It's not like it's a real bully tugging on my shirt.

This is from a real bully, said Ron. He wants you to be sad.
This bully is mean and cruel and what he is doing is bad.
Just because it's on your phone doesn't mean you should not tell.
Bullying on a phone or computer is bullying as well.

These messages are hurtful, mean and cruel.
We must tell your mom or dad or the teacher at the school.
You are not ugly and I am your friend.
Let's go and tell the teacher so that the bullying can end.

So they walked up the hill to tell Teacher Owl at last.
And soon thereafter, the bullying was a thing of the past.

Moral:
When you are being bullied or see someone is being bullied, tell someone you trust.

Question: Why is online bullying just as hurtful as physical bullying?
