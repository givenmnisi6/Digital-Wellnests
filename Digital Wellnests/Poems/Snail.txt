6-Safety Snail's e-mails

Jenny the Snail has just received mail
But this was not a normal letter
It’s on the screen in an envelope with black script
And she thought: “This is even better!”

One day Jenny visited her e-mail
And saw a letter from a stranger,
It was written in characters of hearts and cabbage
And because she didn’t know the person, she suspected danger.

Instead of clicking to read, she decided to delete the e-mail
So Jenny selected the icon with the dustbin
And although she is a very curious snail
Jenny knows today she did win

Moral:
Do not open unknown or suspicious e-mails or messages.
